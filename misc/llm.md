# AI-assisted Programming Tools (such as ChatGPT)

Toward the end of the last year, the Large Language Models chat bots (such as ChatGPT) has demonstrated its capability of generating code. I hope that you can use this technology to enrich your leaning experiences. However, there are also concerns about plagiarism and cheating. Below are ground rules:  

- Including AI-generated code in your submission is regarded as cheating in this course. 

- However, using AI-assisted tools to diagnose your code is not cheating. 
  
For example, you can ask the chatbot, "what is wrong with my code?" and then fix the problem. This is not cheating. 
If you ask the chat bot, "write xxxxx code for me." and then copy and paste it in the submission, it is cheating. 

In your exam, you will not have access to those tools, as you will write the program on the paper.
